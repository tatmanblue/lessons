# Two dimension arrays
The purpose of this lesson is to learn about 2 dimension arrays


# Requirements
1. Ask the user how many elements in an array to use.  Number must be between 2 and 10
2. Randomly assign values into the arrays and print out the data
3. Add the values the arrays and output result
4. Multiply the values the arrays and output result
5. Ask the user if they want to try again

# Step 1
Write the program flow control

# Step 2
Get user input for number of elements in the array.  Keep asking the user
until they no longer want to try again.  The satisifies the requirements
1 and 5.

# Step 3
Randomly assign data to array and print the results

# Step 4
Implements the add and multiply methods and output results

# Step 5
cleans up the code
