# Two dimension arrays
The purpose of this lesson is to learn about 2 dimension arrays


# Requirements
1. Ask the user how many elements in an array to use.  Number must be between 2 and 10
2. Randomly assign values into the arrays and print out the data
3. Add the values the arrays and output result
4. Multiply the values the arrays and output result
5. Ask the user if they want to try again

# Process
We will solive the above requirements by doing steps individually rather than all at once

# Step 1
### Goal: simply outline in code how we expect the app to behave
Write the program flow control

# Step 2
### Goal: add the functions that ask the user for input until the user asks to stop
Get user input for number of elements in the array.  Keep asking the user
until they no longer want to try again.  The satisifies the requirements
1 and 5.

# Step 3
### Goal: randomly generate data and print it
This satisifies step 2.

# Step 4
### Goal: Implements the add and multiply methods and output results.  
This satisifies step 3 and 4.

# Step 5
cleans up the code

# Step 6 Bonus Material
1 - use pointers instead of passing the array around, allow for dynamic memory allocation
2 - fix possible int overrun in multiplication
